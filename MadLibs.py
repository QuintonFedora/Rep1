#Create a Story Template
#Design a story with placeholders for different types of words.
#For example:
#"Once upon a time, there was a [noun] who loved to [verb] with their [adjective] [noun]."

#Gather User Input
#Your program should ask the user to input the following:
#A person's name (make sure the name is formatted in title case).
#A month, day, and year (for a specific date).
#At least 5 nouns, 5 verbs, 3 adjectives, and 2 adverbs.

#Replace Placeholders
# #Use the words provided by the user to replace the placeholders in your story template.
# This should be done using f-strings to format the output.
#Display the Final Story
#After gathering all the inputs, display their name,
#followed by a new line, the date (mm/dd/yy), followed by a new line,
#then the completed story to the user with the words they provided


User_name = input("What is your name? (capitalized)")
What_date = input('What is a Month, Day , and Year? (mm/dd/yy)')
Nouns = input('')
